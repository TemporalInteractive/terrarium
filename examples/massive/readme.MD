# Massive

This example showcases how to render a massive environment using Terrarium. [specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs) is used to manage large numbers of meshes in a performant manner. It's recommended to extend your engines world representation in specs as well, however this is not required.

The `TestScene.glb` is too big for git, but can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Phta9UH7fvtCCOQMh3c0YxrL6kYzjcJc/view?usp=sharing). Please put it in the assets folder.
